    <article><div><h1>Sustainability and Energy Efficancy Projects</h1><p>I'm a guy who lives on planet Earth. For that reason, I want it be clean and healthy.</p><p>Now a healthy Earth can mean alot of things. So I've done work in alot of things.</p><p>## Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Analysis ### Description:  This project involved going into low-incomes homes and installing sensors to monitor the air quality before and after renovation. I joined the project towards the tail end but as soon as I joined. I became the only one working on it. I was in charge of contacting building and property managers, organizing visit dates, installing the sensors, collecting and analyzing the data, and reporting the findings. So pretty much everything. ### Skills: Technical: Data Analysis, Visualization, Regression, R programming Soft: Communication, Time management ### Proof: <a href="https://github.com/zdelk/sf_Kresge">Github Repo</a>   <a href="https://link.com/to_pdf_maybe">Final Deliverable</a></p><p>## IAQ Sensor Network ### Description: After doing the project above, I learned it I dont like using other people's sensors. They tend to diswaid the users (me) from trying to fix the sensors in lieu of buying brand new ones for alot of money. The monitors used also required a subscription to access the data. And even though you play them alot of money, thier dashboards kinda stink and its hard to pull data from thier site. THEY DONT EVEN HAVE AN API (atleast when I was doing the project). So, I decided to figure something else out. After a long search I came across an open source IAQ monior from AirGradient. A Diy kit was ordered. Code was written to connect it to a server (Promethous) being hosted on a embedded system (RaspberryPi). More code was written to automate the process of pulling data and sending it to my email.  ### Skills: Technical: Embedded Systems (RaspberryPi), Python, Time-series Database (Promethous), Real-time Visualizations (Grafana)   Soft: Researching, Technical Writing ### Proof: <a href="https://github.com/zdelk/IAQ_Pi_network">Github Repo</a>   <a href="https://zdelk.grafana.net/public-dashboards/ea14be1063c647dabec262c3f1ddec0f">Grafana Dashboard</a></p><p>## 40 Year Temperature Analysis for Atlanta ### Description I've cared about the weather for quite a while. This project was presented at the Kennesaw State University R-Day. I didn't win anything but I'm still proud of my work. And my main graph looks pretty sick. ### Skills: <b>Technical:</b> Data Analysis, Regression, Statistics, R programming   <b>Soft:</b> Presentation, Communication ### Proof: <a href="https://link.com/my_poster">Poster</a></p></div></article>
