    <article><div><h1>Data Projects</h1><p><a href="/static_site/">< Back Home</a></p><p><img src="/static_site/images/yawn.png" alt="Yawn image"></img></p><p>I like working with data because it helps make sense of the world. Whether it's building models, visualizing trends, or pulling insights from messy datasets, I enjoy the process of turning numbers into something meaningful.</p><h2>Optimizing Residential HVAC Systems</h2><h3>Summary</h3><p>This DOE-funded project evaluated smart diagnostic tools for residential HVAC systems. My job was to clean and analyze field-collected commissioning data to assess their effectiveness.</p><h3>What I Built</h3><ul><li>Filtered noisy HVAC sensor data for statistical integrity  </li><li>Developed quality filters later adopted by the device developers  </li><li>Produced insights and visualizations showing performance trends</li></ul><h3>Skills & Tools</h3><ul><li><b>Technical:</b> R, Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Visualization  </li><li><b>Soft:</b> Technical Communication, Report Generation</li></ul><h3>Links & Media</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2406423">Published Paper</a></li></ul><h2>Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Analysis</h2><h3>Summary</h3><p>This community-focused project involved monitoring indoor air quality in low-income homes before and after renovations. Although I joined near the end, I became the sole lead on the project and took charge of every aspect.</p><h3>What I Built</h3><ul><li>Contacted property managers and scheduled site visits  </li><li>Installed IAQ sensors and managed their data  </li><li>Analyzed pre- and post-renovation air quality  </li><li>Delivered final findings in a formal report</li></ul><h3>Skills & Tools</h3><ul><li><b>Technical:</b> Data Analysis, R, Regression Modeling, Visualization  </li><li><b>Soft:</b> Communication, Time Management, Project Ownership</li></ul><h3>Links & Media</h3><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/zdelk/sf_Kresge">GitHub Repo</a>  </li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLN8B5jeQ87wIvqb74JZT3VUIM9rT5Mq/view?usp=sharing">Final Report</a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Opczzv322UYmG3LOOzjvhOiqCu9fsS7I/view?usp=sharing">Tenant Infographic</a></li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p>This project assessed the potential energy savings achievable by upgrading single-family homes across Georgia. It supported strategic planning for an EnergyShed initiative led by Georgia Tech by identifying where retrofits would be most impactful.</p><h3>What I Built</h3><ul><li>Aggregated data on Georgia's existing housing stock by age, type, and region  </li><li>Created baseline energy models for representative homes from different construction eras  </li><li>Simulated energy performance for homes with various efficiency upgrades  </li><li>Calculated and compared energy savings potential across housing archetypes  </li><li>Produced data visualizations and summary statistics for stakeholders</li></ul><h3>Skills & Tools</h3><ul><li><b>Technical:</b> Building Energy Modeling (BEopt), Data Analysis (R/Python), Excel  </li><li><b>Soft:</b> Research Synthesis, Technical Communication, Collaboration with Stakeholders</li></ul><h3>Links & Media</h3><ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iykORjsjEmDrG9D3gE0eqXoM6AQWTvmo/view?usp=sharing">Final Report</a></li></ul><h2>40-Year Temperature Trends in Atlanta</h2><h3>Summary</h3><p>This was a personal project analyzing 40 years of Atlanta temperature data. I presented it at KSU’s R Day. I didn’t place, but I gained experience in long-term climate data analysis and visual storytelling.</p><h3>What I Built</h3><ul><li>Cleaned and structured decades of NOAA temperature data  </li><li>Performed statistical regression to analyze warming trends  </li><li>Created clear visuals that told the story behind the numbers</li></ul><h3>Skills & Tools</h3><ul><li><b>Technical:</b> R, Regression, Statistics, Data Visualization  </li><li><b>Soft:</b> Scientific Communication, Presentation Skills</li></ul><h3>Links & Media</h3><ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PK-vpbhxUrUa2X58lgExtIRo8kBpAQli/view?usp=sharing">Final Poster</a></li></ul><h2>League of Legends Match Outcome Analysis</h2><h3>Summary</h3><p>For a statistics class final, I explored what factors predict winning in League of Legends. I pulled match data from Riot’s API and found that first-dragon advantage correlates strongly with match outcomes.</p><h3>What I Built</h3><ul><li>Wrote an R script to query and clean Riot Games match data  </li><li>Built a regression model to identify predictive features  </li><li>Generated insights for early match advantage indicators</li></ul><h3>Skills & Tools</h3><ul><li><b>Technical:</b> R, API Data Handling, Predictive Modeling  </li><li><b>Soft:</b> Report Writing, Data Storytelling</li></ul><h3>Links & Media</h3><ul><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1om3vMGXek8zl-OtgcLf0Z6edgUNImBVU/view?usp=sharing">Final Report</a></li></ul></div></article>
