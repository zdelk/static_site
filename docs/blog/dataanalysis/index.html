    <article><div><h1>Data Projects</h1><p><a href="/static_site/">< Back Home</a></p><p><img src="/static_site/images/yawn.png" alt="Yawn image"></img></p><p>I like working with data because it helps make sense of the world. Whether it's building models, visualizing trends, or pulling insights from messy datasets, I enjoy the process of turning numbers into something meaningful.</p><h2>Optimizing Residential HVAC Systems</h2><p>### Summary   This DOE-funded project evaluated smart diagnostic tools for residential HVAC systems. My job was to clean and analyze field-collected commissioning data to assess their effectiveness.</p><p>### What I Built   - Filtered noisy HVAC sensor data for statistical integrity   - Developed quality filters later adopted by the device developers   - Produced insights and visualizations showing performance trends</p><p>### Skills & Tools  - <b>Technical:</b> R, Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Visualization   - <b>Soft:</b> Technical Communication, Report Generation</p><p>### Links & Media   - <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2406423">Published Paper</a></p><h2>Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Analysis</h2><p>### Summary   This community-focused project involved monitoring indoor air quality in low-income homes before and after renovations. Although I joined near the end, I became the sole lead on the project and took charge of every aspect.</p><p>### What I Built - Contacted property managers and scheduled site visits   - Installed IAQ sensors and managed their data   - Analyzed pre- and post-renovation air quality   - Delivered final findings in a formal report</p><p>### Skills & Tools  - <b>Technical:</b> Data Analysis, R, Regression Modeling, Visualization   - <b>Soft:</b> Communication, Time Management, Project Ownership</p><p>### Links & Media   - <a href="https://github.com/zdelk/sf_Kresge">GitHub Repo</a>   - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLN8B5jeQ87wIvqb74JZT3VUIM9rT5Mq/view?usp=sharing">Final Report</a> - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Opczzv322UYmG3LOOzjvhOiqCu9fsS7I/view?usp=sharing">Tenant Infographic</a></p><p>### Summary   This project assessed the potential energy savings achievable by upgrading single-family homes across Georgia. It supported strategic planning for an EnergyShed initiative led by Georgia Tech by identifying where retrofits would be most impactful.</p><p>### What I Built   - Aggregated data on Georgia's existing housing stock by age, type, and region   - Created baseline energy models for representative homes from different construction eras   - Simulated energy performance for homes with various efficiency upgrades   - Calculated and compared energy savings potential across housing archetypes   - Produced data visualizations and summary statistics for stakeholders</p><p>### Skills & Tools  - <b>Technical:</b> Building Energy Modeling (BEopt), Data Analysis (R/Python), Excel   - <b>Soft:</b> Research Synthesis, Technical Communication, Collaboration with Stakeholders</p><p>### Links & Media  - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iykORjsjEmDrG9D3gE0eqXoM6AQWTvmo/view?usp=sharing">Final Report</a> ## 40-Year Temperature Trends in Atlanta</p><p>### Summary   This was a personal project analyzing 40 years of Atlanta temperature data. I presented it at KSU’s R Day. I didn’t place, but I gained experience in long-term climate data analysis and visual storytelling.</p><p>### What I Built  - Cleaned and structured decades of NOAA temperature data   - Performed statistical regression to analyze warming trends   - Created clear visuals that told the story behind the numbers</p><p>### Skills & Tools  - <b>Technical:</b> R, Regression, Statistics, Data Visualization   - <b>Soft:</b> Scientific Communication, Presentation Skills</p><p>### Links & Media   - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PK-vpbhxUrUa2X58lgExtIRo8kBpAQli/view?usp=sharing">Final Poster</a></p><h2>League of Legends Match Outcome Analysis</h2><p>### Summary  For a statistics class final, I explored what factors predict winning in League of Legends. I pulled match data from Riot’s API and found that first-dragon advantage correlates strongly with match outcomes.</p><p>### What I Built  - Wrote an R script to query and clean Riot Games match data   - Built a regression model to identify predictive features   - Generated insights for early match advantage indicators</p><p>### Skills & Tools  - <b>Technical:</b> R, API Data Handling, Predictive Modeling   - <b>Soft:</b> Report Writing, Data Storytelling</p><p>### Links & Media   - <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1om3vMGXek8zl-OtgcLf0Z6edgUNImBVU/view?usp=sharing">Final Report</a></p></div></article>
