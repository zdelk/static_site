Most of my data analysis projects are related to sustainability.</p><h2>Optimizing Residential HVAC Systems</h2><h3>Description</h3><p>This was Building America (DOE) funded project that investigated the outcome of using a smart diagnostic tool for residential HVAC installation and commissioning. My task was to analyze the data the was taken by the diagnostic tools. This included things like airflow, fan draw, line pressures, and temperature readings. A big part of the project involved data cleaning. I developed multiple filters to ensure only quality data was used for the analysis. Some of this filters were later implemented by the smart tool creators after consulting with them. With the clean data, I was able to perform statically significant analysis and create various visualizations.</p><p>### Skills <b>Technical:</b>  Data Analysis, Visualization, R programming   <b>Soft:</b> Communication, Report Generation, Storytelling</p><p>### Proof <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/2406423">Published Paper</a></p><h2>Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Analysis</h2><h3>Description</h3><p>This project involved going into low-incomes homes and installing sensors to monitor the air quality before and after renovation. I joined the project towards the tail end but as soon as I joined. I became the only one working on it. I was in charge of contacting building and property managers, organizing visit dates, installing the sensors, collecting and analyzing the data, and reporting the findings. So pretty much everything.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p><b>Technical</b>: Data Analysis, Visualization, Regression, R programming   <b>Soft</b>: Communication, Time-management</p><p>### Proof <a href="https://github.com/zdelk/sf_Kresge">Github Repo</a>   <a href="https://link.com/to_pdf_maybe">Final Deliverable</a></p><h2>40 Year Temperature Analysis for Atlanta</h2><h3>Description</h3><p>I've cared about the weather for quite a while. This project was presented at the Kennesaw State University R-Day. I didn't win anything but I'm still proud of my work. And my main graph looks pretty sick.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p><b>Technical:</b> Data Analysis, Regression, Statistics, R programming   <b>Soft:</b> Presentation, Communication</p><h3>Proof:</h3><p><a href="https://link.com/my_poster">Poster</a></p><p>This final project is a little disconnected from the other but it was a fun project.</p><h2>League of Legends Game Analysis</h2><h3>Description</h3><p>This was the final project for a stats class. We could make the project about anything we could get data for and at the time I was pretty in to League of Legends (LOL) with is a popular MOBA game. I was never very good at the game, but I was extremely curious to see if there what knowledge could be gained from looking at the data for high level matches. This projected involved pulling match data from Riot's (the company that created the game) API and preforming various types of analysis on it. The end goal was the develop a method of predicting the winner of a match as early as possible. From what I found, the team that kills the first dragon wins the match about 60% of the time.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p><b>Technical:</b> Regression, Prediction, R programming <b>Soft:</b> Report Generation, Data Story Telling</p><h2>Proof</h2><p><a href="https://link.com/loldata">Report</a></p></div></article>
