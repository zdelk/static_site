My portion mainly involved running simulation for various energy levels and processing the results. The full paper can be found <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75459-1">here</a>.</p><h3>Optimizing Residential HVAC Systems</h3><p>This was Building America (DOE) funded project that investigated the outcome of using a smart diagnostic tool for residential HVAC installation and commissioning</p></div></article>
