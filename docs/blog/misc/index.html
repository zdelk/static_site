    <article><div><h1>Miscellaneous</h1><p><a href="/static_site/">< Back Home</a></p><p><img src="/static_site/images/beef.png" alt="beef image"></img></p><p>These are a few meaningful projects that don’t quite fit elsewhere. They reflect my background in physics, teaching, and science communication, all areas that still inform how I approach technical problems today.</p><h2>Optics Research</h2><p>### Summary During undergrad, I worked in two theoretical optics research groups. With Dr. Jeremy Gulley, I studied Intense-Ultrashort Laser-Pulse Propagation. With Dr. Nicolas Douguet, I supported research on Circular Dichroism in Multiphoton Ionization. The latter resulted in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75459-1">published paper</a> I contributed to.</p><h2>Physics Labs Demo Videos</h2><p>### Summary As the Head TA for the Physics department, I created instructional videos for new lab equipment used in introductory physics labs. These demonstrations helped professors, students, and other TAs adapt to updated coursework. The videos are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOD1V5YnWgWAjGFogrNXoMuNe7Y_-uusL">here</a>.</p><h2>Society of Physics Students Presentation</h2><p>### Summary While serving as President of the Society of Physics Students, I helped raise the club’s visibility by organizing a panel at KSU’s annual OwlCon convention. The session, “Physicists vs Engineers,” explored science fiction concepts through the lens of real-world physics. Our slide deck is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1onzngULZl9arWtnnxOosv_nwC5AJ5HHK/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p></div></article>
