Hello, I'm Zachary Delk. I like cats, data, and robotics. My background is broad and doesn't fit neatly in a one page resume. This site showcases some of the personal, academic, and research projects I've worked on over the years.

## General Overview

I hold a Master’s degree in Intelligent Robotic Systems from Kennesaw State University, along with dual Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Physics. My work spans robotics, data science, embedded systems, and applied research in energy and sustainability.
