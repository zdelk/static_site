This section showcases projects that reflect my interest in automation, controls, and code. Whether it's machine learning, embedded systems, or simulations, I enjoy building things that move, think, or learn.

## IAQ Sensor Network

### Summary

A DIY indoor air quality monitoring system built using open-source hardware and self-hosted infrastructure. Designed to collect, visualize, and automatically report environmental data without relying on proprietary sensors or cloud services.

### What I Built  

- Configured Raspberry Pi as a Wi-Fi access point and data gateway  
- Integrated multiple AirGradient One sensors to auto-connect via Wi-Fi  
- Developed Python scripts to collect, parse, and forward data  
- Deployed InfluxDB for local time-series storage and Prometheus for monitoring  
- Created dashboards in Grafana for real-time data visualization  
- Implemented secure remote access via Tailscale

### Skills & Tools  

- **Technical:** Python, InfluxDB, Grafana, Prometheus, Embedded Systems, Networking  
- **Soft:** Systems Thinking, Troubleshooting, Independent Research, Technical Writing

## Anomaly Detection in Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Summary:  

Final project in an Automation class focused on detecting inefficiencies in a simulated production line. We trained a neural network on time-series data from a marble sorting machine.

### What I Built 

- Used a Raspberry Pi and Arduino to simulate manufacturing data  
- Trained a PyTorch neural net to identify anomalies  
- Evaluated system performance despite I/O publishing limitations

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** Python, PyTorch, Embedded Systems (Arduino & Raspberry Pi), Time-Series Machine Learning, Convolutional Neural Network
- **Soft:** Teamwork, Troubleshooting, Iterative Testing

## Command Line Blackjack (In Progress)

### Summary:  

A personal side project to get better at Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal is to create a fully functional blackjack game you can play in the terminal.

### What I Built 

- Designed game logic using OOP structure in Python  
- Implemented playable version of blackjack via CLI  
- Planning to integrate card counting or CPU players

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** Python, OOP, CLI Game Logic  
- **Soft:** Self-Directed Learning, Project Design
