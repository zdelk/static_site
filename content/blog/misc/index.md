These are a few meaningful projects that don’t quite fit elsewhere. They reflect my background in physics, teaching, and science communication, all areas that still inform how I approach technical problems today.

## Optics Research

**Summary**

During undergrad, I worked in two theoretical optics research groups. With Dr. Jeremy Gulley, I studied Intense-Ultrashort Laser-Pulse Propagation. With Dr. Nicolas Douguet, I supported research on Circular Dichroism in Multiphoton Ionization. The latter resulted in a [published paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75459-1) I contributed to.

## Physics Labs Demo Videos

**Summary**

As the Head TA for the Physics department, I created instructional videos for new lab equipment used in introductory physics labs. These demonstrations helped professors, students, and other TAs adapt to updated coursework. The videos are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOD1V5YnWgWAjGFogrNXoMuNe7Y\_-uusL).

## Society of Physics Students Presentation

**Summary**

While serving as President of the Society of Physics Students, I helped raise the club’s visibility by organizing a panel at KSU’s annual OwlCon convention. The session, “Physicists vs Engineers,” explored science fiction concepts through the lens of real-world physics. Our slide deck is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1onzngULZl9arWtnnxOosv\_nwC5AJ5HHK/view?usp=sharing).
