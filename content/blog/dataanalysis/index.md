I like working with data because it helps make sense of the world. Whether it's building models, visualizing trends, or pulling insights from messy datasets, I enjoy the process of turning numbers into something meaningful.

## Optimizing Residential HVAC Systems

### Summary  

This DOE-funded project evaluated smart diagnostic tools for residential HVAC systems. My job was to clean and analyze field-collected commissioning data to assess their effectiveness.

### What I Built  

- Filtered noisy HVAC sensor data for statistical integrity  
- Developed quality filters later adopted by the device developers  
- Produced insights and visualizations showing performance trends

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** R, Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Visualization  
- **Soft:** Technical Communication, Report Generation

## Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Analysis

### Summary  

This community-focused project involved monitoring indoor air quality in low-income homes before and after renovations. Although I joined near the end, I became the sole lead on the project and took charge of every aspect.

### What I Built

- Contacted property managers and scheduled site visits  
- Installed IAQ sensors and managed their data  
- Analyzed pre- and post-renovation air quality  
- Delivered final findings in a formal report

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** Data Analysis, R, Regression Modeling, Visualization  
- **Soft:** Communication, Time Management, Project Ownership

### Summary  

This project assessed the potential energy savings achievable by upgrading single-family homes across Georgia. It supported strategic planning for an EnergyShed initiative led by Georgia Tech by identifying where retrofits would be most impactful.

### What I Built  

- Aggregated data on Georgia's existing housing stock by age, type, and region  
- Created baseline energy models for representative homes from different construction eras  
- Simulated energy performance for homes with various efficiency upgrades  
- Calculated and compared energy savings potential across housing archetypes  
- Produced data visualizations and summary statistics for stakeholders

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** Building Energy Modeling (BEopt), Data Analysis (R/Python), Excel  
- **Soft:** Research Synthesis, Technical Communication, Collaboration with Stakeholders

## 40-Year Temperature Trends in Atlanta

### Summary  

This was a personal project analyzing 40 years of Atlanta temperature data. I presented it at KSU’s R Day. I didn’t place, but I gained experience in long-term climate data analysis and visual storytelling.

### What I Built 

- Cleaned and structured decades of NOAA temperature data  
- Performed statistical regression to analyze warming trends  
- Created clear visuals that told the story behind the numbers

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** R, Regression, Statistics, Data Visualization  
- **Soft:** Scientific Communication, Presentation Skills

## League of Legends Match Outcome Analysis

### Summary 

For a statistics class final, I explored what factors predict winning in League of Legends. I pulled match data from Riot’s API and found that first-dragon advantage correlates strongly with match outcomes.

### What I Built 

- Wrote an R script to query and clean Riot Games match data  
- Built a regression model to identify predictive features  
- Generated insights for early match advantage indicators

### Skills & Tools 

- **Technical:** R, API Data Handling, Predictive Modeling  
- **Soft:** Report Writing, Data Storytelling
